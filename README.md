# Blue UI Library
[Blue](https://github.com/helpscout/blue) is the UI behind Beacon and upcoming chat tools. It extends the base [HS App component library](https://github.com/helpscout/library-hsapp) and is currently maintained by Buzz and Q.

## Usage
This is library can be considered the core UI and patterns for the newest Help Scout features such as Beacon Embed, HS Chat and Timeline, and a super simple way to create quick and accurate mockups. For examples on **how** to use these components read [the Wiki](https://github.com/helpscout/library-blue/wiki) or view the [Example Usage Files](https://github.com/helpscout/library-blue/blob/master/Beacon%20Example%20Usage.sketch)
